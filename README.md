It can be seen that ruby is a programming language with dynamic typing. This means that it is not always necessary to define the type of variable to be used at all times.

### String  
String is a string of characters that form words, phrases or what can be displayed in the form of text. Follow the example above in "string.rb".

### Float  
Float, is the type of variable used to define variables of "broken" numbers.

### Boolean
When a variable of type "Boolean" is typed, it has only two paths, or it will be defined with "TRUE" that confirms something or "FALSE" that denies something.

### Integer  
The name itself says, integers, are those that are not "broken" numbers

### Array
Array is a data structure to which you can tie variables within it

### Symbol
Creating two identical "Symbols" saves you memory space. Two identical strings occupy more than one memory space.

### Hash
A rash has its organizational form much like an array. The few differences are due to the way it is inserted, values and keys, it works like a dictionary, you can put a key right after that key will store a value.

### Operators
To perform the mathematical operations in ruby we have the following arithmetic operators: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, module and exponent.

### Data Input and Output
Output operations "PUTS" or "PRINT" allows displaying the data on the console.  
Input operations "GETS" allows entering data into the program.

### Control Structures   
Control structure is one of the most interesting means and opens up a range of possibilities in simpler scripts. It is possible to make different decisions in the code to validate something, for example.  
"If" used to validate a condition "IF" it is true, if false it is used "ELSE".
We use "ELSIF" if we have more than one condition to check.  
We also have the "UNLESS" which works in a way contrary to the "IF". If "IF" is validated when the expression is true, "UNLESS" is validated when it is false.  
And last but not least "CASE", is used to validate between to validate some predetermined choices and discard those that are invalid.
