It can be seen that ruby is a programming language with dynamic typing. This means that it is not always necessary to define the type of variable to be used at all times.

### String  
String is a string of characters that form words, phrases or what can be displayed in the form of text. Follow the example above in "string.rb".

### Float  
Float, is the type of variable used to define variables of "broken" numbers.

### Boolean
When a variable of type "Boolean" is typed, it has only two paths, or it will be defined with "TRUE" that confirms something or "FALSE" that denies something.

### Integer  
The name itself says, integers, are those that are not "broken" numbers

### Array
Array is a data structure to which you can tie variables within it

### Symbol
Creating two identical "Symbols" saves you memory space. Two identical strings occupy more than one memory space.

### Hash
A rash has its organizational form much like an array. The few differences are due to the way it is inserted, values and keys, it works like a dictionary, you can put a key right after that key will store a value.
